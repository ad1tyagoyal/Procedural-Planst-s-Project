So far i have implemented the following things
1. Creation of a sphere which a fine control over vertices(details, resolution)
2. Scriptable objects for shape and color settings for planet
3. A noise map using perlin noise algorithm which will define the terrain shape of the planet 



This unity project can create procedural planets with different terrain styles implemented using perlin noise algorithm and you can stack different noise layers on top on each 
other to get your desired terrain. 
Assign colors to the terrain using a graident which will create a texture for the planet with colors of each point according to its height.
